### Being a beginner at React (and JavaScript)
* After learning basics of React I created my first 'typical' 'user submits form and new item shows on screen' app.
* Before starting the project I learned:
  * my first React hook - useState - to call component function again when we change our (variable) state,
 
### Create React App
* This app was created with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>.

### CSS
* I wanted to practice some CSS, but I did not expect that I would be so much work to make my app look nice.
* So maybe I should consider using **Material UI** and **Bootstrap** if I want to only focus on React.

### About and TO DO
* Besides begin a typical beginner React app I added showing moods that user submitted on the calendar.
* This is a thing that can (and should) be expanded - right now app only tracks your moods in Semptember 2021.
* I would like someday to add other types of mood trackers, for example 'Year In Pixels' tracker.
* There are other features that can be added, but I think that I should learn more things about React first.
<!-- * However first I want to learn about Testing Library and how to do Unit testing with React -->
