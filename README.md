### Being a beginner at React
* After learning basics of React I created my first 'typical' 'user submits form and new item shows on screen' app.
* Before starting the project I learned:
  * my first React hook - useState - to call component function again when we change our (variable) state to show it on screen again with new value.
 
### Create React App
* This app was created with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>.

### CSS
* I did not expect that it would be so much work to make my app look nice. It was nice doing some CSS, but maybe I should consider using **Material UI** and **Bootstrap** if I want to focus only on React.

### TO DO
* Right now app only tracks user's moods in Semptember 2021, that's why I would like to add tracker for every month in 2021 and 2022.
* Also there can be other types of mood trackers that could be implemented, for example 'Year In Pixels' tracker.

</p>

* There are many features that can be added, but I think that I should learn more things about React first.
